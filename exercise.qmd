## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

```{r}
x <- data("mtcars")
x
1+1
```

```{r}
2+2
2/2

```

```{r}
a <- 3
b <- 4
a*b
a/b
a-b
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

```{r}
pls = 44
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
